# Dataset Information

You can find the training and testing data for this project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Datasets Used

**Training dataset:**  
[Dog Breeds Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darshanthakare/dog-breeds-image-dataset)

**Testing dataset:**  
[Dog Breeds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedchahed/dog-breeds)

Download both datasets to the same folder and extract the archives.  
Make sure to rename the top **`dog-breeds`** folder to **`Testing Data`** to avoid confusion.  
We'll refer to the testing data this way throughout the course.

Your folder structure should look like this:
[target folder]
  ├─ Dog Breeds Image Dataset/
  └─ Testing Data/

Once the data is organized this way, you’ll be ready to continue with the next step in the project.
